Weather DashBoard

# HERE WE GO
It took me a fairly long time to figure out API's. Sorry. Once I figured out using the network tag after inspecting the html I had figured out that i had not been referencing the right things the whole time and or in the right way and therefore not actually getting any of the data properly. (Wow proper values are important! who knew?!). After doing that I looked back into referencing and went from there. I used a basic table method to display the data.

# USER STORY

THEN i can obtain data from cities.
WHEN i use the Weather Search button.
THEN i can pull data from the openweathermap api.
WHEN i want to see past data.
THEN i can click on my input and pull up past data searches.
